**Tievs is a web based code complexity checking software tool built using PHP/Javascript/HTML/CSS languages to monitor the quality complexity values and their specific weightages, to give an insight to the user on which ways can the development cost and efforts be reduced and maintained of different Java or C++ files.**

+ Steps on how to use Tievs code complexity checking tool

1. The files can uploaded to the system through Tievs home page by clicking 'Browse' button there and browsing current files present in the users local machine   as single files or by compressed into a zip folder.

2. In addition, by clicking the 'Configure Component Weights' button, the user is allowed to change the weights defaultly allocated to a particular component factor (Size, Variables, Methods, Control Structures).

3. After configuring those values (if necessary) the user can go ahead and click the 'Analyse' button which will then trigger all necessary logical functions that contribute in calculating complexity values due to size, variables, methods and control structures considering all code lines of the files submiited as a zip folder or singularly.

4. Then the user will be directed to the page where all the values and information is presented with regard to the complexities of the files/file submitted and the files/file successfully uploaded alert will be visible at the very top of the page for 3 seconds if the action was successful.

5. At the very top of the page, the user will be able to find the different files of the uploaded zip folder or the single file, as newly created clickable grey buttons.

6. By clicking a particular button of a certian file, the user can view the the specific tables which presents one by on the complexity of the program/file due to size, variables, methods and control structures factors and also All factors(Cs, Cv, Cm, Ccs, TCps) and the relevant summation values.

7. After the generated buttons section, the user is able to see the red bar which holds the final Program Complexity value which is calculated by adding the summed TCps values taken from each of the files/file in the program uploaded. 

8. Then the user can view the dynamic graph which depicts visually the seprately stored complexities of the files uploaded with the X axis showing their names and the Y axis showing their total complexity values which then can be compared with each of the other files.

9. Finally at the end of the page, the user can find the 'Generate Reports' section with three clickable buttons which generates the PDF format of their specific report (considering all submitted files)

        - Factor Tables Report
        - All Factor Table Report
        - Program & File Complexity Report
